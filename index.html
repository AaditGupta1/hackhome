        <p id="aboutp">Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. There are five main aspects of personal health: physical, emotional, social, spiritual, and intellectual. Having good health is directly related to leading a productive life. The functionality of the body is interconnected between various organs. Keeping the organs healthy is essential for proper functioning. As health is the state of physical, mental and social well-being, having good health is important.</p>
